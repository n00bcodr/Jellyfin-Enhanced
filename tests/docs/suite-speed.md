# Suite-speed validation

Behavioral source base: r21 (`b1a9ee65`). Measurements use one approved slot on Alex's laptop, Node 26.7.0 and SDK 10.0.401, affinity `0-3,6-9`, niceness 10 and aggregate MemoryMax 20 GiB. Each mode has its own source snapshot, reports and temporary directories. This is one paired series on a shared laptop, not an isolated-machine throughput estimate.

| Change | Before seconds | After seconds | Behavioral cases |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Immutable frontend instrumentation reuse, existing file scheduling | 768.80 | 263.63 | 3,674 → 3,674 |

The cache-only comparison retains all 239 production JS files, identical instrumentation point schemas and identical denominators. Every global and core-module floor remains enforced. Covered-hit variation is disclosed:

| Metric | Before covered | After covered | Unchanged denominator |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Statements | 38,440 | 38,426 | 56,112 |
| Branches | 26,402 | 26,394 | 43,752 |
| Functions | 5,655 | 5,653 | 8,095 |
| Lines | 32,982 | 32,978 | 46,423 |

The uncached baseline retains a cancellation at the existing 11-second Q13 deadline; cache-only completes all frontend cases without changing that deadline or its assertions. The inherited backend StampFeed failure remains visible. These are diagnostic measurements and do not certify a green full suite.

Regressions exercise real instrumented production text, changed source/filename/options, independent jsdom realms and counters, cross-process disk reuse, and rejection of corrupt cache text. Cache entries contain strings only and include the dependency-lock identity. Source transforms still have to apply before lookup; the zero-hit source inventory remains unchanged.

Complete receipts and subsequent steps are recorded in the coordinator's `suite-speed-report.md` and the retained lane artifacts.
