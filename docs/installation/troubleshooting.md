## Log files for troubleshooting

When reporting a bug or issue with the Jellyfin Enhanced plugin, providing logs is crucial for diagnosing the problem. There are three main types of logs that might be needed based on the issue:

1.  **Console Logs (Browser):** These logs capture messages, errors, and warnings generated by the plugins scripts when running or trying to run in your browser.
    -   **When are they needed:** Best for script not loading at all, issue with a feature, errors when clicking buttons, visual glitches, etc,
    -   **What to look for:** Filter the console with `"🪼Jellyfin Enhanced"` and look for any errors.

2.  **Network Logs (Browser):** These logs record all the network requests made by your browser tab. This includes requests made by Jellyfin Enhanced to the Jellyfin server. These record all the proxy calls to TMDB, and Jellyseerr also settings being updated and read from server storage.

    -   **When needed:** Best for issues related to data not loading, features failing to communicate with the server (like Jellyseerr search/requests, saving settings, Elsewhere lookups), or slow performance potentially caused by network problems.
    -   **What to look for:** Filter the log with `"JellyfinEnhanced"` and look for any errors in status codes.


3.  **Server Logs (`Jellyfin Admin Dashboard > Logs`):** These logs are generated by the Jellyfin server itself and capture backend activity, including plugin operations, API requests, and potential server-side errors.

    -   **When needed:** Best for issues related to plugin installation, server-side configuration problems (like Jellyseerr connection failures reported by the plugin settings page test button), permission errors (like failing to modify `index.html`), or crashes.
    -  **What to look for:** Look for errors mentioning `"JellyfinEnhanced"` or `"Jellyfin Enhanced"` also look for errors int he log files by Jellyfin Enhanced (e.g. `JellyfinEnhanced_yyyy-mm-dd.log`)


!!! tip
    
    If you do not know how to access your Browser's Developer Tools to collect the logs, you should really use the power of internet to figure that out — An [internet search like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+access+my+browser%27s+developer+tools%3F) would suffice :D



## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows

If you see permission denied errors:

1. Navigate to your Jellyfin installation folder (usually `C:\Program Files\Jellyfin\Server`)
2. Right-click the folder → Properties → Security
3. Grant "NETWORK SERVICE" **Read** and **Write** permissions
4. Apply to all subfolders and files
5. Restart Jellyfin service

### Linux
